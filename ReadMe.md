Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository hosts my files for the Course Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data class of the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

run_analysis.R is the code that that does the following: 

  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

tidyData.txt is the file output from Step 5 above. 

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
